# Intro

This is a clock based on Mithril, Webpack 2 and yeah that's it! No JSX, no nothing basically!

*It's a toy project I made over a couple of evenings. Don't let the looks deceive you, it's
stupid as hell*

Also a warning: it's using my own eslint config that's not published yet.
Deployment pipeline is also pretty KISS (manually SCPs it to my own website).
No test, no CI, no CD, no nothing. It's just a quick try to see how PWAs work.
If you find it interesting consider donating from your left pocket to your right pocket (or vice
versa) and call it a day!
